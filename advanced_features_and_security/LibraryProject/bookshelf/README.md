### Django Access Control Implementation

This project implements user groups and permissions to restrict access to certain views.

#### Step 1: Define Custom Permissions
- Added `can_view`, `can_create`, `can_edit`, and `can_delete` permissions in the `Article` model.

#### Step 2: Create and Configure Groups
- Created `Editors`, `Viewers`, and `Admins` groups with specific permissions.
- Editors: `can_create`, `can_edit`
- Viewers: `can_view`
- Admins: All permissions

#### Step 3: Enforce Permissions in Views
- Used `@permission_required` decorators to check permissions before allowing actions.
- Implemented logic for `create_article`, `edit_article`, and `delete_article` views to handle article management securely.

#### Step 4: Test Permissions
- Create test users and assign them to groups.
- Log in with different users and attempt actions.

#### Step 5: Documentation
- This README explains the setup and how to manage users, groups, and permissions.
